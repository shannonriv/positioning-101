    <h1>ABSOLUTE</h1>
    <p>If the relative value acts like Superman, then the 
    absolute value mirrors Inception—a place where you design 
    your own world. Unlike the static and relative values, 
    an absolutely positioned element is removed from the 
    normal flow. This means you can put it anywhere, and 
    it won’t affect or be affected by any other element in 
    the flow. Exactly like the relative value, absolutely 
    positioned elements respond to offset properties for 
    positioning. Example E shows four boxes, each in a 
    corner of the browser window. Since we set each box’s 
    position value to absolute, we’ve essentially velcroed 
    a box to each corner of our browser window. As you 
    resize the browser, those boxes will stay in their 
    respective corners. If you shrink the browser window 
    so that the boxes overlap, you’ll notice that there is 
    no interaction at all—that’s because they’re out of 
    the document’s normal flow.</p>
