    <h1>CREATING A COORDINATE SYSTEM</h1>
    <p>Creating a coordinate system for child elements is another 
    one of the relative positioning property’s super powers. A 
    coordinate system is a reference point for offset properties. 
    Example D shows our new markup. Because of the new coordinate 
    system, the blue block measures its offset 200 pixels from the 
    left of the red block (#box_1) instead of the document. This 
    practice is more common with elements set to position: 
    absolute—the way you wish you could have built towers when you 
    were younger.</p>
